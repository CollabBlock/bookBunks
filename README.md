Thought we might need to concern: since we focus on frontend rn

how to:

1. Fetch data?
2. Handle request/response errors?
3. Show a loading indicator?
4. Display the data on the website?
5. Make the UI mobile friendly?
6. Make the UI accessible?
7. Add a hover effect?
8. Build a popover menu?
9. Hide/show content on a button click?
10. Validate inputs (e.g. age input should only accept numbers)?
11. Disable buttons if the form is not filled?
12. Add onClick, onMouseOver, onKeyPress events?
13. Block the default event execution?
14. Attach headers and body to requests?
15. Display success/error messages?
